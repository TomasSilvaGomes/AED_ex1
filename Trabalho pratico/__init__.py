'''
For the Formula 1 Pit Stop Optimization Challenge, we can create a priority formula that takes into account several factors such as tire wear, fuel level, and current race position. Here’s the suggested formula:

		Priority= w1⋅Tire Wear + w2⋅Fuel Level + w3⋅Race Position
Where:
•	(w_1, w_2, w_3) are weights that determine the importance of each factor.
•	Tire Wear is a value between 0 (new tires) and 1 (completely worn out).
•	Fuel Level is a percentage of the fuel tank, with 100% being full and 0% being empty.
•	Race Position is the inverse of the current position (e.g., 1st place = 20, 20th place = 1).
